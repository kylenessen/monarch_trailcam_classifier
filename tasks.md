- Keyboard Shortcuts when minimized can't be unminimized
- Next Unclassified button not working
- Excessive warnings about editing beyond confirmed photos. Should only trigger when trying to make an annotation, not just when viewing.
- Reset image works on confirmed images. This should be disabled.
- I would like to be able to change the working folder from the main window. 
- Build in a progress bar for number of photos left to process
- Incorporate a zoom feature, where the selected cell is zoomed in. Surrounding cells too?
