- I would like to be able to change the working folder from the main window. 
- Build in a progress bar for number of photos left to process
- Incorporate a zoom feature, where the selected cell is zoomed in. Surrounding cells too?
- make confirmed green border larger
- Change default size so you don't have to resize the window every time.
- Add ability to save user name and incorporate that into the classifications file
