# Prompt

I would like your help to develop a new feature for my @/electron-app/ . Right now there is a default and unchangeable number of cell grids that the app utilizes. I would like the option to have to change the resolution that I can select at the beginning of a new deployment. I imagine this feature only becomes relevant when loading a folder without a configurations.json file. the app should prompt the user what resolution they want, and then it will generate the appropriate number of cells within that configuration.json file.The user should not be able to change the resolution once that file has been generated. It's important that it stays consistent. And the only way to regenerate it is to delete the configurations file. I think the simplest way to do this is simply ask the user the number of columns and rows they want for that deployment. Provide a default value, which is whatever I'm using currently. This feature will require you to carefully examine the existing code and perhaps rewrite some of the existing logic. I would like to enforce a square ratio for the cells. So it'll be important to calculate the aspect ratio of the image and have some mechanisms to ensure that an appropriate ratio of columns to rows is enforced. Maintain the same naming convention for the grid cells within the configuration.json file. Do you have any questions for me?
