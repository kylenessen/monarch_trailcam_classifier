# Prompt

I would like your help to develop a new feature for my @/electron-app/ . Right now there is a default and unchangeable number of cell grids that the app utilizes. I would like the option to have to change the resolution that I can select at the beginning of a new deployment. I imagine this feature only becomes relevant when loading a folder without a configurations.json file. the app should prompt the user what resolution they want, and then it will generate the appropriate number of cells within that configuration.json file.The user should not be able to change the resolution once that file has been generated. It's important that it stays consistent. And the only way to regenerate it is to delete the configurations file. I think the simplest way to do this is simply ask the user the number of columns and rows they want for that deployment. Provide a default value, which is whatever I'm using currently. This feature will require you to carefully examine the existing code and perhaps rewrite some of the existing logic. I would like to enforce a square ratio for the cells. So it'll be important to calculate the aspect ratio of the image and have some mechanisms to ensure that an appropriate ratio of columns to rows is enforced. Maintain the same naming convention for the grid cells within the configuration.json file. Do you have any questions for me?

# Implementation Plan (Dynamic Grid Resolution)

This plan outlines the steps to allow users to define the grid resolution (rows and columns) for a new deployment. It assumes that existing `configurations.json` files will be manually updated or handled separately to conform to the new structure if needed.

**New `configurations.json` Structure:**

When a configuration is generated for a new deployment, the file will have the following structure:

```json
{
  "rows": <user_input_rows>,
  "columns": <calculated_columns>,
  "classifications": {
     // Image filename keys and their cell data will be added here
     // e.g., "image1.JPG": { "confirmed": false, "cells": {...}, ... },
     //       "image2.JPG": { "confirmed": false, "cells": {...}, ... }
  }
}
```

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Modify State Management (`electron-app/src/renderer/modules/state.js`):**
    *   Remove the exported `GRID_CONFIG` constant (`{ columns: 16, rows: 9 }`).
    *   Introduce a new state variable, `currentGridConfig`, initialized to `{ rows: null, columns: null }`.
    *   Update the `createDefaultGridCells` function to use `currentState.currentGridConfig.rows` and `currentState.currentGridConfig.columns` when generating the default cell structure for a *new* image classification entry.
    *   Consider adding getter/setter functions for `currentGridConfig` for cleaner access (e.g., `getGridConfig()`, `setGridConfig(rows, columns)`).

2.  **Modify File Loading Logic (Likely in `electron-app/src/renderer/modules/file-system.js`'s `loadClassifications` or the calling function in `renderer.js`):**
    *   When a deployment folder is selected, construct the path to `configurations.json`.
    *   Use an IPC call (e.g., `window.electronAPI.checkFileExists`) to check if `configurations.json` exists.
    *   **If it exists:**
        *   Load and parse the JSON content (`parsedData`).
        *   **Crucially, validate that `parsedData.rows`, `parsedData.columns`, and `parsedData.classifications` exist.** If not, show an error indicating an invalid/corrupted configuration file.
        *   Update the `currentGridConfig` state using `parsedData.rows` and `parsedData.columns`.
        *   Load the object from `parsedData.classifications` into the main `classifications` state.
        *   Proceed with loading the first image.
    *   **If it does *not* exist:**
        *   Identify the first image file in the `imagesFolder`.
        *   Use `getImageData` (or an equivalent IPC call) to get the dimensions (`initialImageWidth`, `initialImageHeight`) of this first image. Store these temporarily.
        *   Trigger the display of the UI prompt (Step 3) to get the desired row count. **Do not load any images for display yet.**

3.  **Create UI Prompt (New function/logic in `electron-app/src/renderer/modules/ui.js` or potentially a new module):**
    *   Implement a modal dialog (e.g., using HTML `<dialog>` element or a library).
    *   The modal should:
        *   Prompt the user: "Enter the desired number of grid rows for this deployment:".
        *   Display the default value (9 rows) as a placeholder or initial value in the input field.
        *   Include a number input field (`<input type="number">`) for the row count (min value 1).
        *   Have a "Confirm" button and possibly a "Cancel" button (which would abort loading the folder).
    *   The "Confirm" button's event handler will:
        *   Read and validate the user's input for rows (`userRows`). Must be a positive integer.
        *   Retrieve the stored `initialImageWidth` and `initialImageHeight`.
        *   Calculate the number of columns: `calculatedColumns = Math.max(1, Math.round(userRows * (initialImageWidth / initialImageHeight)))`. Ensure at least 1 column.
        *   Update the `currentGridConfig` state: `updateState({ currentGridConfig: { rows: userRows, columns: calculatedColumns } });`.
        *   Create the initial `configurations.json` content string: `JSON.stringify({ rows: userRows, columns: calculatedColumns, classifications: {} }, null, 2)`.
        *   Use an IPC call (e.g., `window.electronAPI.saveFileContent`) to write this string to `configurations.json` in the `deploymentFolder`. Handle potential errors during saving.
        *   Initialize the main `classifications` state in the application: `updateState({ classifications: {} });`.
        *   Close/hide the modal.
        *   Signal the main application flow (e.g., via a callback or promise resolution) to proceed with loading the first image using the now-defined configuration.

4.  **Modify Grid Creation (`electron-app/src/renderer/modules/image-grid.js`):**
    *   In the `createGrid` function:
        *   Retrieve the current grid dimensions: `const { rows, columns } = getCurrentState().currentGridConfig;`.
        *   Use these `rows` and `columns` variables in the loops and style calculations instead of the old `GRID_CONFIG.rows` and `GRID_CONFIG.columns`.

5.  **Modify Initialization (`electron-app/src/renderer/renderer.js`):**
    *   Refactor the application's initialization sequence triggered by folder selection (`handleFolderSelection` or similar).
    *   Ensure that the process waits for the `configurations.json` loading/creation logic (including the potential UI prompt) to complete *before* attempting to load the first image (`loadImageByIndex(0)`) and display the grid. This might involve using `async/await` or Promises to manage the flow.
