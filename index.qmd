## Overview
This guide provides instructions for using Monarch Image Labeler to estimate monarch butterfly numbers in gridded images. The goal is to efficiently categorize butterfly counts while maintaining consistency across different observers.

## Getting Started

### Basic Controls
- Use `S` or `→`to go to next photo
- Use `A` or `←` to go to previous photo
- Use `Space` to zoom in 300% for detailed inspection
- Press `W` or click "Confirm Image" to save and proceed
- Press `S` to copy classifications from previous image
- Use `N` to toggle notes for unusual circumstances
- "Switch to Color" button toggles between B&W and color views
- Keyboard shortcuts can be referenced anytime from the button in the top right.

### Count Categories
Each grid cell is categorized by the number of butterflies present:

- 0 (Default): No butterflies (No color)
- 1-9: Single digits (Yellow)
- 10-99: Dozens (Orange)
- 100-999: Hundreds (Red)
- 1000+: Thousands (Purple)

## Classification Process

### 1. Initial Assessment
1. Begin with the most densely populated cells
2. Use Space-bar zoom (300%) to inspect unclear areas
3. All cells start as 0 (uncolored) by default

### 2. Dense Cluster Protocol
For cells with large clusters:

- If butterflies clearly exceed 100, classify as hundreds (red)
- For dense clusters where butterflies may be obscured, apply a 1.3X multiplier
- Example: If you can count ~80 butterflies in a dense cluster, multiply by 1.3 = 104, classify as hundreds
- Only apply this multiplier when butterflies are likely obscured in dense clusters

### 3. Medium Density Areas
- If more than a few butterflies but not obviously hundreds, classify as dozens (orange)
- No need to get exact counts - if you can quickly count <10, it's yellow; if it takes longer, it's likely orange

### 4. Scanning for Singles
- After marking dense areas, scan for isolated butterflies or small groups
- Include both flying and roosting butterflies
- For 1-9 butterflies, mark as yellow

### 5. Border Cases
When clusters cross grid lines:
- Only count butterflies within the current cell
- Round up when in doubt
- Some double-counting at borders is acceptable given the coarse estimation scale

### 6. Sunlight Labeling
- For cells containing butterflies, note if they are in full sun
- Only label sun exposure for cells that contain butterflies
- Use F + Click to toggle sunlight for a cell

## Best Practices

### Speed vs. Accuracy
- Prioritize efficiency over precise counts
- When uncertain between categories, round up
- The goal is order-of-magnitude estimation
- Don't spend excessive time on exact counts

### Required Steps Before Moving On
4. Ensure username is entered
5. Complete all cell classifications
6. Mark sunlight exposure where applicable
7. Add notes if necessary (blue button indicates notes present)
8. Confirm image to save and proceed
