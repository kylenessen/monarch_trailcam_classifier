## Sampling interval
- Run statistical analysis for SC1 and 2 and 4, with different sampling intervals
- Information theoritic approach
- Compare AIC to justify reduced sampling interval
- Can also use graphs to visually justify different intervals
- Consider doing plotting wind and sun
- variance comparison
- how well lines fit to each other

### Wind Hypothesis
- Do clustering monarch respond to strong wind events
- Sub hypothsis, the kingston hypothesis, do monarchs vacate cluster locations if winds exceed 5 mph



I would like your help summarizing wind data (`wind`) within monarch observation dataframe (`df`). Here's the basic idea: I have photos taken at regular intervals of the butterflies. I count those butterflies within that frame in the column "count". Now I would like to add some additional columns so I can invesitage whether wind speed affects monarch numbers. In my wind dataframe, I have a higher frequency set of measurements (every minute or so). So what I would like to do is build a set of wind dependent variables that occurred between two photos. For example, if I have two rows, one at 12:00pm and the next at 12:05pm, I would like to summarize the wind data between those two times and assign the values to the 12:05pm row. I would like to do this for all rows in the dataframe. Determining the interval should be done dynamically, as it is not the same for all deployment IDs. You can, however, join on deployment_id. That should be good across the datasets. 

To start, let's summarize average wind speed, average wind gust, and maximum gust. Please use the mph columns.
