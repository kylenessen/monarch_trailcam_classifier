## Sampling interval
- Run statistical analysis for SC1 and 2 and 4, with different sampling intervals
- Information theoritic approach
- Compare AIC to justify reduced sampling interval
- Can also use graphs to visually justify different intervals
- Consider doing plotting wind and sun
- variance comparison
- how well lines fit to each other

## Chapter 1
### Wind Hypothesis
- Do clustering monarch respond to strong wind events
- Sub hypothsis, the kingston hypothesis, do monarchs vacate cluster locations if winds exceed 5 mph
