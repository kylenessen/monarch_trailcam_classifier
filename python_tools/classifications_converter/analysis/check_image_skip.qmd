## Background

The purpose of this script is that it is taking a long time to classify the images. And part of the problem there is I set the interval at a really high frequency. So for most of the deployments it was 10 minutes. But for the first two that I have classified, it was every five minutes. And what I'm hoping to discover in this notebook is whether I can skip some number of images and have it tell the same story, thereby reducing the total number of images that I have to manually label.

## Load Data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# Get list of all CSV files in the data directory
csv_files <- list.files(path = "python_tools/classifications_converter/analysis/data", pattern = "*.csv", full.names = TRUE)

# Read and combine all CSV files, properly parsing timestamp
df <- csv_files %>%
    map_df(~read_csv(.x) %>%
           mutate(timestamp = ymd_hms(timestamp, tz = "America/Los_Angeles")))
```
